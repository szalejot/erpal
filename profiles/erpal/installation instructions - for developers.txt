How to install Erpal using drush make:

1. Clone this repository - Success!

// FOR WINDOWS 
If you want to install on windows make sure you have the newest dev release of "Drush 5.x".
You can download it here: http://drupal.org/project/drush
Replace your existing drush files in "C:/Program Data/Drush" with the downloaded ones.
Make sure, drush is set as a path variable in windows:
 - Go to System settings -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables
 - Create a new variable "PATH" with the value "C:\ProgramData\Drush\"
// END Windows

2. Go to the erpal folder where the makefile is:
Execute "drush make build-erpal.make ../www" in your console/bash. It will now download all necessary files and put them in the folder "../www".

3. The root directory of the erpal installation should be the "www" folder just created.

4. go into the www/profiles/erpal folder and copy the "contrib" folder to a secure place

5. delete the www/profiles/erpal folder

6. checkout the repository git clone gitolite@bsfiles2:erpal/erpal into www/profiles

7. copy the "contrib" folder back to www/profiles/modules

8. put this contrib folder on .gitignore (if its not already there)

9. work on THAT repository.
